# Docsy

Docsy is a PDF question-answering app. Upload a PDF, it breaks it into chunks, generates embeddings, and stores them in a vector store. Ask questions about the PDF, and it finds relevant chunks and generates answers using a large language model (LLM).

## Features
- Upload PDFs and process them into searchable chunks.
- Generate embeddings and store them in FAISS.
- Ask questions about PDFs and get answers via an LLM.
- Simple interface built with Streamlit.

## Technologies
Python, Streamlit, LangChain, FAISS, LLM models

## Installation
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/bpanda-labs/Docsy.git cd Docsy

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv venv\Scripts\activate # Windows source venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Add your API keys in a `.env` file:
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


## Usage
Run the app:

Upload a PDF, ask questions, and get answers generated by the LLM.

## Notes
- Keep `.env` in `.gitignore` to protect API keys.
- Only upload PDFs you have the right to use.
